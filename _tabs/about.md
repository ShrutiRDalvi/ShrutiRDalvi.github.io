On campus when I'm not busy attending classes you'll find me playing basketball, having a conversation about anything under the sun or doing a bunch of other random things. I love playing sports, going on adventures, reading books ,learning about new things and making most of my friends laugh at my jokes. That aside I am a huge nature lover and big time sunset admirer and my phone gallery is filled with pretty sunsets. As for where my career or professional life is headed, I have absolutely no idea and have been living in the delusion that college will help me figure it out.

This blog serves as my personal canvas, where I’ll pour out my thoughts, experiences, and emotions, supplemented with pictures that encapsulate the essence of such moments.I don't know how regular I will be with posting content here, but nevertheless, I hope that every reader gains something worthwhile or insightful from here. I’m incredibly excited to see where this goes, happy reading! 

If you found something interesting, want to have a conversation or have any sort of feedback,feel free to contact me!
