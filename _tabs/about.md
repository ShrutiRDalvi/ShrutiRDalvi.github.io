Hello there! 

My name is Shruti Dalvi and I’m a sophomore studying engineering at IIT Kanpur.

I was born in Goa,India and have been living in Bangalore for the past 10 years(ish).

I love playing sports, going on adventures, reading books ,learning about new things and making *(most of)* my friends laugh with my extremely dirty minded jokes. I’m really excited to explore the world and can’t wait to see what adventures life has in store for me.

This blog serves as my personal canvas, where I’ll pour out my thoughts, experiences, and emotions, supplemented with pictures that encapsulate the essence of such moments.

I don't know how regular I will be with posting content here, but nevertheless, I hope that every reader gains something worthwhile or insightful from here. I’m incredibly excited to see where this goes, happy reading! 

If you found something interesting, want to have a conversation or have any sort of feedback, feel free to contact me! 

Cheers!
