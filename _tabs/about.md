Hello there! 

My name is Shruti and I’m a 19-year old student studying engineering at IIT Kanpur.

![A picture of me was here if you can't see ](/home/shruti/ShrutiRDalvi.github.io/_site/assets/img/favicons/about/IMG_7796 (1).JPG)

I was born in Goa,India and travelled the world as a baby, and have spent the past 10 years in Bangalore.

I love playing sports, going on adventures,reading books ,learning about new things and making *(most of)* my friends laugh. I’m really excited to explore the world and can’t wait to see what adventures life has in store for me.

This blog serves as my personal canvas, where I’ll pour out my thoughts, experiences, and emotions, supplemented with pictures that encapsulate the essence of such moments.

I don't know how regular I will be with posting content here, but nevertheless, I hope that every reader gains something worthwhile or insightful from this. I’m incredibly excited to see where this goes, happy reading! 

If you found something interesting or have any sort of feedback, feel free to contact me! 

Cheers!
