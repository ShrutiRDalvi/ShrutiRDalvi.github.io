I have a favourite saying that goes “ _Time is everything we have and don’t_ ”. About a month ago time got the better of my grandfather. He passed away after a short period of illness. It was sad , unexpected but I dont want to make this about that. Through this post I want to celebrate the life he lived, and share with the world some special memories I have.

For those that knew him, they know he lived a simple and down to earth life filled with love, compassion and wisdom. My grandfather whom we fondly called “_Papa Azo_” had been through a lot over the course of his life. A lot of financial struggle, personal loss, health issues had shaped the person he had become. 


Azo would always tell us as kids “__Do one thing new everyday__”.Back then, I didn’t quite get it. How could I do one new thing everyday? It seemed like a challenge to maintain such a creative mindset. But now, I understand. Embracing new ideas in our daily lives can transform the mundane into something exciting and uncover hidden passions.


I recall a story my mother once shared. My mom and grandfather were walking back home from the market with mangoes. Along the way they met a disabled man begging for alms, and my grandfather very thoughtfully took a ripe mango that they had just bought and gave it to the man. Later, he remarked to my mother that it was a small act of kindness, ensuring that the less fortunate could savor a mango. Azo's life was rooted in caring for others and serving society in any way he could.

Azo always loved embracing the new changes that came his way.Despite his age, he had an insatiable curiosity about technology. "_How do you forward messages?_" he'd ask, or "_How do you free up storage?_" He never stopped learning. I had taught him how to put up status’ on whatsapp, and ever since then he put up atleast one status everyday consisting mainly of quotes or wise sayings with ancient wisdom. Usually they were in Marathi , which I cant really read fluently , but occasionally I tried. The number of viewers didn't matter; his objective was to share knowledge with a small part of the world. I miss those daily status updates now.

He also had a love for exploring new foods. Whenever he came across intriguing or unique snacks in the supermarket, he couldn't resist buying them. His childlike enthusiasm for trying new things and finding joy in the small pleasures of life was truly admirable.

Azo was really fond of mangoes. He studied agriculture back in the day, which explains his love for these tropical treats. I once asked him about grafting mango trees, and he patiently sat me down and walked me through the process with drawings and everything

He knew a lot about the different types of mangoes you find in Goan markets. He'd tell you their origin stories, how to eat them , whether to slice them, or  eat them with a spoon, did they have tiny threads in them, would they taste sweet or sweet and sour, he knew it all.When we went to Goa for vacation, he'd take it upon himself to pick out the very best mangoes from the local markets, making sure we all got a taste of nothing but the best.

I’ll end this post by stating a line that bought tears to my eyes when I read it. In a letter addressed to my grandmother in 1968, Azo wrote “__Let us both so live that when inevitable end will come to us , those living still will feel that we should have lived longer.__” You were successful in that endeavour Azo. Those of us left behind wish you could have stayed with us longer. The world lost a devoted husband, father, and grandfather, and, more importantly, even a kinder and better human being. If I can become even half the person you were, Azo, I will consider myself successful. Heres to a life well lived! Hari Om Tatsat! Om Shanti!
