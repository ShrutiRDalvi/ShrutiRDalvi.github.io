## What this is all about! 

Hello! 

My name is Shruti, and this is the repository for my blog(of sorts).

I've used a Jekyll theme called [**Chirpy**](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy), and you should check it out,from their docs incase you want to make something similar in the future.
